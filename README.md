# Academic_Personnel_SQL

This SQL project implements a full database workflow for managing academic personnel and their positions. 

Tasks include:

- Creating and modifying tables

- Adding constraints (CHECK, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY)
  
- Renaming columns and changing data types
  
- Using TRY...CATCH for controlled error handling
  
- Creating multiple views for data representation


The database includes `Teachers` and `Posts` tables, simulating a real university staff management system.
